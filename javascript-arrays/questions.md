## Frequently asked interview question - (FOR PRACTICE)

Please note that, video materials are only available in [Tamil (தமிழ்)](https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberDudeNetworks/), code solutions with explanations are available in <a href="./solutions.md" target="_blank">English</a>.

**Rules to be followed:**

1. Solve programmatically.
2. If a solution can be solved in other methods, give it a try.
   Remember, there is always several ways to do things.
3. Try to solve it yourself, if you got struck, no problem. [Google it](https://google.com) Yourself. At last resort, see the <a href="./solutions.md" target="_blank">solution of us</a>.
4. Code with fun, Happy Hacking.

### Let's start - Solve these:

1. Create an `Array object` - (In Atleast 3 methods) - [[🎬 Video](https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberDudeNetworks/)] [[Solution](./solutions.md#question-1)]

2. Take the below `array` and copy it using the `slice` method and the `for loop` method. - [[🎬 Video](https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberDudeNetworks/)] [[Solution](./solutions.md#question-2)]

   ```js
   var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   ```

3. Empty this array: - [[🎬 Video](https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberDudeNetworks/)] [[Solution](./solutions.md#question-3)]

   ```js
   var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   ```

4. What type is an `Array` set to? - [[🎬 Video](https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberDudeNetworks/)] [[Solution](./solutions.md#question-4)]

5. How can you check if something is an `Array`? - [[🎬 Video](https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberDudeNetworks/)] [[Solution](./solutions.md#question-5)]

6. Add an `item` to the end of an `array`. - [[🎬 Video](https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberDudeNetworks/)] [[Solution](./solutions.md#question-6)]

7. Find the `index` position of `d` in this array - [[🎬 Video](https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberDudeNetworks/)] [[Solution](./solutions.md#question-7)]

   ```js
   var arr = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
   ```

8. What will be returned if you look for the `index` of something that does not exist? - [[🎬 Video](https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberDudeNetworks/)] [[Solution](./solutions.md#question-8)]

9. Write a function to check if `milk` exists in your `array`. - [[🎬 Video](https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberDudeNetworks/)] [[Solution](./solutions.md#question-9)]

   ```js
   var items = ["milk", "bread", "sugar"];
   ```

10. Now you've found `milk` exists add some code to find the `index` of `milk` and **remove** that item. - [[🎬 Video](https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberDudeNetworks/)] [[Solution](./solutions.md#question-10)]

11. List the ways to `loop over an array`. - [[🎬 Video](https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberDudeNetworks/)] [[Solution](./solutions.md#question-11)]

12. Write some code to put these numbers in order (Ascending & Descending) - [[🎬 Video](https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberDudeNetworks/)] [[Solution](./solutions.md#question-12)]

    ```js
    var numbers = [1, 12, 2, 23, 77, 7, 33, 5, 99, 234];
    ```

13. Write some code to place this list in alphabetical order - [[🎬 Video](https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberDudeNetworks/)] [[Solution](./solutions.md#question-13)]

    ```js
    var p = ["a", "z", "e", "y"];
    ```

14. What is the length of these `arrays` - [[🎬 Video](https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberDudeNetworks/)] [[Solution](./solutions.md#question-14)]

15. What are the results of these `splice` and `slice` methods - [[🎬 Video](https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberDudeNetworks/)] [[Solution](./solutions.md#question-15)]

16. What are the `console logs` of these `shift` and `unshift` methods - [[🎬 Video](https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberDudeNetworks/)] [[Solution](./solutions.md#question-16)]

17. Using `reduce` add all these numbers - [[🎬 Video](https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberDudeNetworks/)] [[Solution](./solutions.md#question-17)]

    ```js
    var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
    ```

18. Flatten this array to one single array using `reduce` - [[🎬 Video](https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberDudeNetworks/)] [[Solution](./solutions.md#question-18)]

    ```js
    var array = [
      [0, 1],
      [2, 3],
      [4, 5],
    ];
    ```

19. Filter this `array` to return just the dogs - [[🎬 Video](https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberDudeNetworks/)] [[Solution](./solutions.md#question-19)]

    ```js
    var animals = [
      { name: "Jason", species: "rabbit" },
      { name: "Jessica", species: "dog" },
      { name: "Jacky", species: "owl" },
      { name: "Luke", species: "fish" },
      { name: "Junior", species: "rat" },
      { name: "Thomas", species: "cat" },
    ];
    ```

20. Using `array` in _Question 19_ use **`map`** function to return all the species. - [[🎬 Video](https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberDudeNetworks/)] [[Solution](./solutions.md#question-20)]
